# DesignPatterns
This repository contains examples on Design patterns developed in C++ using CodeBlocks IDE.

## Concepts
- Creational pattern : Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process.They help make a
system independent of how its objects are created,composed, and represented.
-- Singleton
-- Abstract Factory

- Structural patterns :  Are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.Structural class patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

- Behavioral patterns :  Are concerned with algorithms and theassignment of responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patternsdescribe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patternsof communication between them.
