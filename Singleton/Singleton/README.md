## Leftover work
>Code implementation of Singleton pattern is done.
>Some code comments and explainations are still pending.
>Detailed understanding of singleton pattern is yet to be written.

## Use case
Sometimes it's required to have only one instance of a class. For example
- In a system there should be only one window manager.
- Logger Classes
