# Singleton Pattern


## Leftover work
>Code implementation of Singleton pattern is done.
>Some code comments and explainations are still pending.
>Detailed understanding of singleton pattern is yet to be written.

## Use case
>Sometimes it's important to have only one instance for a class. 
>For example,
>> In a system there should be only one window manager.
>> Logger Classes
>> Configuration Classes and many more.
